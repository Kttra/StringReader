# StringReader
The program takes in a line of text from the user. It then splits the line into words and outputs it to the user while checking which word has the most letter repeats.

If there are words with the same amount of repeated characters, then the program will default to the right most word in the list.

It will assume that spaces indicates a new word. This program is made to test strings and vectors. Primarily to mess around with passing a vector by reference.

```
